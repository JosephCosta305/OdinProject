        <h1>The World of Money and Me</h1>
        <p>
            I walked into Barnes and Noble today and purchased two wonderful books. One is called Cobalt Red, the 
            other <em>The Psychology of Money</em>. I walked in to buy the <em>Cobalt Red</em> after hearing horrific stories of
            Cobalt mining in the Congo made it necessary to dig deeper and learn more. The other was one I
            simply gazed upon and decided to check out. The very first page grabbed my attention immediately. It 
            was about the various ways we perceive money, and how our encounters with it and others related to 
            it can shape our view of the world, even if that view is off or not up to par with the reality 
            we don't see. So I bought both and now I hope to read them in my free time. Hope I can!!!

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            A few of my friends question my sanity when they view my bookshelf, but I don't find anything wrong 
            with the <strong>books themselves</strong>. Rather I could say that my inability to finish reading most of the books 
            I buy is where there really weird stuff arises. I don't quite know why that happens, maybe I get 
            bored easily. Hopefully, I can finish these two.

        <h3>Goodbye, but Not Forever</h3>
        <p>
            I hope this small blog can appear as a test for my html and blog skills. While what I wrote wasn't
            the most deep material I could think of, it was definitely more stress reducing than I imagined. 
            Maybe I shouldn't be too scared, and hopefully I do finish both of my new books. No...I WILL
            finish both of my new books! Goodbye, and have a wonderful day!! :D
